## Description

This software, aims to address the critical challenge of optimising hospital resource management, focusing on the effective allocation and utilisation on hospital beds.

There are many roles involved with efficient bed management including

- Doctors
- Nurses
- Bed Manages
- IT Administrators
- Cleaners

this results in bed management systems having may feature requirements including

- Bed Assignment
- Patient Transfers
- Bed Status Tracking
- Real-time Dashboard
- Updatable Wards & Beds
- Cross-platform Compatibility
- User-friendly Design

The motivation for this project comes from the hospital bed shortage faced in Ireland. The increasing wait times have resulted in more patients on trolleys; making them susceptible to infection and potential poor outcome. Efficient bed management can potentially help reduce waiting times by speeding up the bed allocation process.

Through careful research of existing literature and practices, some key design choices and features were made. For example, to eliminate the potential of typos, QR codes can be used to access all information and actions for a specific bed.

The System aims to meet the complex requirements of hospital bed management using a web application. Automating the bed management process can have huge impacts resulting in

- Saving staff time
- Improved patient care
- Cost savings through optimisation

#### Real-time dashboard

![Dashboard](/docs/images/Dashboard.png)

The dashboard provides a real-time overview of the hospital's bed occupancy and navigation to the different features of the system.

#### Bed assignment

![Bed Assignment](/docs/images/Bed%20Assignment.png)

The bed assignment feature allows doctors and nurses to assign a patient to a bed by inputting their details which shows all available beds that meet the patients requirements (Gender & Age).

#### Bed Status Tracking

![Bed Status](/docs/images/Bed%20Status.png)

The bed status page seen in the above figure shows the status of a given bed and the patient information if occupied. The bed status is updated in real-time.

#### Patient Transfers

![Patient Transfer](/docs/images/Patient%20Transfer.png)

The patient transfer screen allows users to request a transfer for a patient to another bed in the same or different hospital. The request can then only be approved by the bed manager where the patient is being transferred to.

#### User Management

![Manage Users](/docs/images/Manage%20Users.png)

The user management page allows administrators to create and delete user accounts. The page also allows administrators to assign roles to users. After entering the details of a new users, a pop-up will appear to enter a password for the new user.

#### Ward & Bed Management

![Manage Wards & Beds](/docs/images/Manage%20Beds.png)

The ward and bed management page allows administrators to create and delete wards and beds.

#### QR code navigation

![QR Code](/docs/images/QR%20code.png)

QR codes similar to the one above are generated for every bed in the hospital. These QR codes can be scanned to navigate to the bed status page for that bed.

#### Bed Cleaning Management

![Cleaning Required Tag](/docs/images/Cleaning%20Required%20Tag.png)

![Mark as Cleaned button](/docs/images/Mark%20as%20cleaned%20button.png)

When a patient is discharged from a bed, the bed is marked as requiring cleaning. Once cleaned the bed can then be marked as available for a new patient.

#### Unique User Roles

| Features                         | Doctors & Nurses | Bed Managers | Administrators |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
